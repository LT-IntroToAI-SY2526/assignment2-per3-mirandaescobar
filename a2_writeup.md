# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?

What was most difficult for me while completing the match function was understanding the current thing of the pattern if it was using a %. This was most difficlut for me because i was a bit confused about infinite loops. It was helpful when we evaluated it as a class and then I went to AI to explain it in a different ways. I also found it helpfil that we broke the function into 2 parts (2 days) to evaluate the 2 parts working to together create the whole function.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

 I could use the match function when extracting information from the database to answer the questions prompted for the given assignment. For example, it could return the movie titles in a list of movies prompted or the integer of which the movie was released.
